# Salary Prediction with Machine Learning

This project predicts employee salaries based on different features using machine learning models. The goal is to analyze employee data, preprocess it, and apply regression techniques to build an accurate salary prediction system.

📌 Project Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand salary trends.

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, normalization).

Implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms.

Model evaluation using performance metrics.

Salary prediction for unseen data.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:

pandas, numpy (data manipulation)

matplotlib, seaborn (visualization)

scikit-learn (ML models and evaluation)
